> Personal sharing about my First Cloud Journey experience and suggestions for improvement.

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
Professional and realistic; mentors are always ready to help when I hit blockers. No notable difficulties encountered.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
Mentor support is frequent and responsive—reviews and guidance come quickly whenever I ask. This helped unblock issues promptly.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
Work is frontend-focused; most AWS services were new to me, so I gained significant cloud knowledge beyond my current FE background.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Learned AWS services hands-on and improved teamwork skills in a production-like setting.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
Positive culture where everyone commits to the work. Improvement needed: teammates should reply to group messages more promptly to keep alignment.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
Flexible hours; overall policies feel reasonable for interns.
