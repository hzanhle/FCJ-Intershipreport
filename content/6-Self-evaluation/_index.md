During my 13-week internship with the AWS First Cloud Journey Program (Sep 8 – Dec 4, 2025), I focused on the frontend of an IoT Security Infrastructure Platform and integrated it with AWS services (DynamoDB, S3, SES, Amplify, Route 53, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda). I built user-facing flows for secure auth, data access, file handling, and notifications while aligning the app with the program’s architecture and security standards. This strengthened my frontend engineering, cloud service integration, IaC/DevOps collaboration, and technical communication. I consistently delivered high-quality work, followed FCJ guidelines, engaged with the AWS community, and collaborated closely with mentors and teammates.

To objectively reflect on my internship journey, I evaluated myself against the criteria below:

### Detailed Self-Assessment

- **Professional knowledge & skills:** Built and iterated the frontend with React/TypeScript and AWS Amplify; integrated Cognito for auth, API Gateway/Lambda for backend calls, DynamoDB for data, S3 for assets, SES for notifications, and Route 53 for domains; maintained code quality via reviews and linting.
- **Ability to learn:** Ramped quickly on Amplify hosting, Cognito auth flows, DynamoDB access patterns, SES email configs, and API Gateway/Lambda integration; validated through docs, labs, and event takeaways.
- **Proactiveness:** Proposed and implemented UX and automation improvements (streamlined auth, safer file handling, alert emails); attended extra AWS community sessions to bring best practices back to the team.
- **Sense of responsibility:** Met weekly deliverables, kept a detailed worklog, and ensured security/quality gates (tests, scans) were met before merges.
- **Discipline:** Followed the FCJ schedule and attended all 6 events; a few deliverables needed minor schedule adjustments, communicated early.
- **Progressive mindset:** Sought mentor feedback on frontend architecture and AWS usage; iterated on patterns for auth, storage, and deployment; applied lessons on least-privilege and observability.
- **Communication:** Authored architecture notes, maintained concise worklogs, translated three technical blogs, and presented platform updates; aiming for even more succinct presentations.
- **Teamwork:** Coordinated with a five-member team, paired on debugging integration issues, and shared event learnings with fellow interns and the AWS community.
- **Professional conduct:** Maintained respectful, constructive interactions; upheld FCJ standards; supported peers during code reviews and knowledge sharing.
